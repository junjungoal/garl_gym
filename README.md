## Environments

| Environment name              | Overview                                                                                                                                                               |

| Simple Population Dynamics    | The simplest environment where new agents are generated according to a certain ratio against the population of predator or prey                                        |
| Simple Population Dynamics GA | New agents are generated by a mating function where two agents need to get close to each other to reproduce a new agent. This event happens with a certain probability |
| Genetic Population Dynamics   | Evolutionary algorithm is incorporated into the system.  New agents are generated in the same way as the Simple Population Dynamics|
